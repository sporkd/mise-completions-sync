## How to Add a Tool

1. Check if the tool supports shell completions:
   ```bash
   mise x <tool> -- <tool> completion --help
   mise x <tool> -- <tool> --help | grep -i complet
   ```

2. Find the correct completion command pattern

3. Add entry to `registry.toml`:
   ```toml
   # If it matches an existing pattern:
   newtool = "standard"  # for: newtool completion <shell>

   # Or with explicit commands:
   newtool = { zsh = "newtool completions zsh", bash = "newtool completions bash" }
   ```

4. Test the entry:
   ```bash
   uv run scripts/validate-registry.py --installed-only
   ```

5. Submit a PR
